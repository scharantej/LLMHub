<h1>Concepts of Large Language Models</h1>
<h2>Training Data</h2>
<p>LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text. The size and quality of the training data is critical to the performance of the model. The most common type of training data is text from the internet, such as news articles, blog posts, and social media posts.</p>
<h2>Model Architecture</h2>
<p>LLMs are typically based on a transformer neural network architecture. Transformers are a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for processing sequential data, such as text. Transformers allow the model to learn the relationships between different words and phrases in a sentence.</p>
<h2>Evaluation Metrics</h2>
<p>The performance of LLMs is typically evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, perplexity, and BLEU score. Accuracy measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model. Perplexity measures how well the model can predict the next word in a sequence of text. BLEU score measures the similarity between the output of the model and human-generated text.</p>
